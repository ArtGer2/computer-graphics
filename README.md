This repository contains tasks completed as part of the "Computer Graphics" course. The assignments cover key aspects of working with graphical objects in both 2D and 3D space, studying various types of curves, and implementing visualization algorithms.

## Contents

1. **Transformation of Graphical Objects in 2D and 3D Space**
    - This section covers the primary methods for transforming graphical objects, including:
        - Parallel and central projection.
        - Rotation, scaling, and translation of objects.
        - Perspective transformations.

2. **Forming Cubic, Parabolic, B-Spline, and Bézier Curves**
    - Development and implementation of algorithms for constructing various types of curves, including:
        - Cubic curves.
        - Parabolic curves.
        - B-splines.
        - Bézier curves.

3. **Finding Parameters for Intersections of Line Segments, Curves, and Surfaces**
    - This section presents methods and algorithms for finding intersection points:
        - Between line segments and straight lines.
        - Between curves.
        - Between surfaces.

4. **Implementation of Visualization Algorithms for Line Segments and Polygons in Specified Windows**
    - Tasks related to the implementation and optimization of visualization algorithms:
        - Line segments (Bresenham's algorithm, DDA, etc.).
        - Polygons (Sutherland-Hodgman clipping algorithm and others).

5. **Identifying Visible Edges and Surfaces of Volumetric Objects**
    - Algorithms for identifying and visualizing visible surfaces and edges of three-dimensional objects:
        - Z-buffer and Z-sorting algorithms.
        - Back-face culling.

## Lab Work: Depth Map Visualization of a 3D Scene Using CUDA

As part of the final lab work, a program was developed that visualizes the depth map of a 3D scene. The program leverages GPU and parallel computing on the CUDA platform to accelerate the rendering process. This allows for efficient processing of large volumes of data and provides accurate depth representation of the scene in real-time.
